paths:
  # Full path to the HDF5 file containing the final generated 3D structures.
  # This is the output from the chebnet_gen_multi.py script.
  generated_h5_path: "generated_structures/multi_system_generated_coords.h5"
  
  # Directory where the new PDB files will be saved.
  # A sub-directory will be created for each system (e.g., 'system_0', 'system_1').

  # --- CRUCIAL: PDB Templates ---
  # This list provides the original PDB files that correspond to each system ID.
  # The order is important: the first path corresponds to System ID 0, the second to System ID 1, and so on.
  # This is required to get the correct atom names, residue info, etc.
  # You must list ALL original PDBs that were used in the chebnet_multi_final.py run.
  template_pdb_paths:
    - "/scratch/asengar/long_sim/apo_d2_inv_start/run6/heavy_chain.pdb"  # Corresponds to system_0
    - "/scratch/asengar/long_sim/apo_d1/run1/heavy_chain.pdb"      # Corresponds to system_1
    - "/scratch/asengar/long_sim/apo_A2AR/run1/heavy_chain.pdb"    # Corresponds to system_2
    - "/scratch/asengar/long_sim/apo_beta1/run1/heavy_chain.pdb"   # Corresponds to system_3
    - "/scratch/asengar/long_sim/apo_M1/heavy_chain.pdb"           # Corresponds to system_4
    # Add more paths here if you trained on more than 5 systems...
    # - "/path/to/system_5.pdb"
    # - "/path/to/system_6.pdb"


settings:
  # The maximum number of PDB files to save for each system.
  # If a system has 5000 generated frames, this will limit the output to the first 100.
  max_frames_to_save: 100
