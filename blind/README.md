# Project Title: Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations (LD-FPG Implementation)

## ðŸ§¬ Overview

This repository provides a Python-based implementation of the **Latent Diffusion for Full Protein Generation (LD-FPG)** framework, focusing on the **Blind Pooling** strategy. The goal is to generate diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of proteins by learning from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation data. This work is intended for submission to NeurIPS 2025 and is based on the methodology described in the accompanying paper, "Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings."
